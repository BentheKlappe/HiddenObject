#Design Choices

==visuals==
A Hidden Object game has everything you could want. It has a competitive feel 
because you get more points, the faster you click. But it also has a relaxing
feel to it, because you won't get really punished in this game. 

I chose a kitchen scene because it has nothing to do with the hospital. Often
the kitchen is also the place where you can eat or make delicious food, and
therefore it might make a child/person feel better or at ease. At the very least
it probably won't have a negative effect.

The items in the game are just random, I'm not an artist, and these icons were
easily accessible for me. I did try to make the items feel like they somewhat
belonged there.

==audio==
The audio I added was chosen with the idea that it should be a happy, uplifting
sound. So the background music has a sort of jazzy vibe to it, and the other
sound effects are somewhat cartoonish.

==hierarchy==
The structure of the hierarchy is something that I like doing. using the = symbol
to seperate different parts of what is presented in the scene gives me some 
peace of mind, and makes it easy to see what is what and where to find it.

==code==
In code I always like to add as much comments as needed, to make it clear for 
myself and others what the code does. If it is too obvious or self explanatory, 
I won't add a comment.
